## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Maven** - Ensure Maven is installed on your IDE. [Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- **JavaFX SDK** - Required for running the application.

### Instructions

1. **Import Project**
   - Open Eclipse and click on `File -> Import`.
   - Select `Projects from Folder or Archive -> Directory`, choose the project, and click `Finish`.

2. **Maven Update**
   - Right-click on the project, navigate to `Maven -> Update Project`, and wait for the dependencies to download.

3. **Run Application**
   - Open `MainLauncher` in the `Application` package and run it.

### Additional Setup for Mac and Windows

- In the run configuration, add the following VM arguments under `Arguments`:

  ```sh
  --module-path /Path/To/javafx-sdk-16/lib --add-modules=javafx.swing,javafx.graphics,javafx.fxml,javafx.media,javafx.web --add-reads javafx.graphics=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.charts=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio.common=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED
 
 ### Excel File Requirement
   - Place an Excel file named Competitions Participations.xlsx in the project directory. If using a different file, ensure it has the same cell structure.

### Notes
   - The application reads the Excel data upon start, and changes are shown in real-time. However, these changes will only be saved to the Excel file upon closing the program.
